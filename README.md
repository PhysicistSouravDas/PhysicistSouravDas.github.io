# PhysicistSouravDas.github.io
This is my personal static website deployed using [GitHub Pages](https://pages.github.com/). This website is live at [PhysicistSouravDas.GitHub.io](https://physicistsouravdas.github.io). I generally like to create websites using [Django](https://www.djangoproject.com/), but a django website cannot be deployed on GitHub Pages.

My other github repositories which are web-based are also using this site at different paths. \
(Like this one: [PhysicistSouravDas.GitHub.io/Number-Guessing](https://physicistsouravdas.github.io/Number-Guessing)).

I have planned to use [VueJS](https://vuejs.org/) or [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) in this website in future for learning and testing purpose.
